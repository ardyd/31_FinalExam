    What comes in:
      -- An rg.Point.
      -- Two rg.Circle objects (circle1 and circle2)
      -- An rg.RoseWindow.
    What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
    Side effects:  Draws all the following on the given rg.RoseWindow:
      -- Draws the given rg.Point and rg.Circle objects.
      -- Then draws 3 rg.Lines:
            -- one from the given rg.Point to the center of circle1
            -- one from the center of circle1 to the center of circle2
            -- one from the center of circle2 to the given rg.Point
         where the color of each of those lines is the same color
         as the fill color of circle2.
      -- Then draws 3 more rg.Lines:
            -- one from the midpoint of the 1st line above
                 to the midpoint of the 2nd line above
            -- one from the midpoint of the 2nd line above
                 to the midpoint of the 3rd line above
            -- one from the midpoint of the 3rd line above
                 to the midpoint of the 1st line above
         where the color of each of those lines is the same color
         as the fill color of circle2.
